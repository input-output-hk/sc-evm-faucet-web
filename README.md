# SC_EVM Faucet


## 1. Notice

As of [insert date], IOG will no longer be updating or maintaining this repo.

After three months of experimentation with the proof-of-concept EVM sidechain testnet, we have gathered valuable learnings from this experience and this innovative playground. New use cases and functionality were tested, feedback from the community was gathered, and we are now shifting our focus back to the strategic evolution of our sidechains approach.  
  
All information included below is considered publicly available and is free to be leveraged by developers to fork it to build and experiment with their own EVM sidechain solution. Should you have any questions, please reach out to our team on our IOG Discord server.  
## 2. Description
This repository contains everything you need to build and run a faucet that will dispense test tokens for the SC_EVM chain.

## 3. Next steps

If you decide to investigate further, start with the [development instructions](DEVELOPMENT.md) and go from there.  

The repository for the SC_EVM chain is available in [this public GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sc-evm)
