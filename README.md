# SC_EVM Faucet


## 1. Notice

IOG will no longer be updating or maintaining this repository. 

After three months of experimentation with the proof-of-concept EVM sidechain testnet, the team gathered valuable learnings from this experience and this playground. New use cases and functionality were tested, feedback from the community was gathered, and we are now continuing to develop the interoperability solutions in line with the partnerchains framework announced at the Cardano Summit 2023.

All information included in this repository is considered publicly available and is free to be leveraged by developers to fork it to build and experiment with their own EVM sidechain solution. Should you have any questions, please reach out to the team on the [IOG Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/inputoutput).
 
## 2. Description
This repository contains everything you need to build and run a web interface to a faucet dispensing test tokens for the SC_EVM chain.  

## 3. Next steps

If you decide to investigate further, start with the [development instructions](DEVELOPMENT.md) and go from there.  

The repository for the SC_EVM chain is available in [this public GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sc-evm)
